// Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

// Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

// Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

// class Node {
//     public int val;
//     public List<Node> neighbors;
// }


// Test case format:

// For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

// An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

// The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.



// Example 1:


// Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
// 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
// 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
// 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
// 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
// Example 2:


// Input: adjList = [[]]
// Output: [[]]
// Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
// Example 3:

// Input: adjList = []
// Output: []
// Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.


// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
// 1 <= Node.val <= 100
// Node.val is unique for each node.
// There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
// The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
